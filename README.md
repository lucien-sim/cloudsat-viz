# CloudSat/CALIPSO/ERA5 Visualization Tool

Tool to help visualize data from CloudSat, CALIPSO, and the ERA5 renalysis product over the Arctic. The purpose of the tool is to bring these big and disparate datasets together into a single place, so that they can be used to learn about the Arctic atmosphere more efficiently. 

NOTE: The tool is still very much under development!
