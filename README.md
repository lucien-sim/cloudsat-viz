# Air Mass Transformation Visualization Tool

Tool to help visualization data from CloudSat, CALIPSO, and the ERA5 renalysis product over the Arctic. The purpose of the tool is to bring these big and disparate datasets together into a single place, so that they can be efficiently used to help understand air mass transformations in the Arctic. 

NOTE: The tool is still very much under development!
