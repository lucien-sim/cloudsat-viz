                    <h2>Motivation</h2>

                    <p>We know that air mass transformation--the process by which warm, moist air from 
                        the mid latitudes transforms into cold, dry air in the Arctic--plays a critical
                        role in the Arctic climate (eg. 
                        <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0773.1">Woods and Caballero, 2016</a>; 
                        <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL072687">Johansson et al. 2017</a>;
                        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0234-1">Pithan et al., 2018</a>). 
                        As of now, most of our knowledge of air mass
                        transformations comes from studies that rely on physical models of the atmosphere (eg. 
                        <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281983%29040%3C2278%3AOTFOCP%3E2.0.CO%3B2">Curry, 1986</a>;
                        <a href="http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/currydoc/Pinto_JGR102a.pdf">Pinto and Curry, 1996</a>;
                        <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/11490.short">Cronin et al., 2015</a>; 
                        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5621046/">Pithan et al., 2016</a>).
                        Comparatively little of our knowledge comes observational studies (eg. 
                        <a href="http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/currydoc/Curry_JGR102.pdf">Curry et al., 1997</a>). 
                        While I think the models have provided a decent conceptual picture of what air mass 
                        transformations look like, the picture is probably incomplete because all atmospheric 
                        models provide incomplete representations of the Arctic atmosphere. In other words, 
                        we have a rough idea of what the transformation process should look like, according to theory, 
                        but don't really know what the process looks like in the real atmosphere, where all complexities 
                        are at play. 
                    </p>

                    <p>I've built this tool to help look inside the air mass transformation process. The reanalysis 
                        fields (top) give broad pictures of transformation events, while the satellite 
                        observations (bottom) provide snapshots of the clouds during those transformation events. 
                        The tool emphasizes cloud observations because cloud processes are a critical part of air
                        mass transformations. I think the tool will be helpful because bringing these datasets 
                        together is a pretty arduous process: (to my knowledge) 
                        no similar tools are freely available.  
                    </p>

                    <h2>Tool Overview</h2>
                    
                    <p>A sample figure from the data viewing tool is available below. Here's a brief overview 
                        of the figure's key components:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Country outlines are plotted in black on the top panel.</li>
                        <li>The satellite's trajectory is also plotted in black on the top panel. The
                            trajectory is interactive: when you hover over the top panel with your mouse,
                            one or more of the 'radar profiles' becomes active. When this occurs, a tooltip
                            appears showing the radar profile's latitude/longitude/timestamp, and a line appears
                            on the bottom panel, showing the profile's position in the radar swath. </li>
                        <li>Both panels are also completely interactive. Panning through dragging is automatically
                            enabled on both panels, while zooming through scrolling is automatically enabled on the
                            bottom panel. Zooming through scrolling can also be enabled on the top panel via the
                            toolbar on the top right. </li>
                        <li>The name of the ERA5 variable that's plotted in the top panel
                            is given in the panel's title. </li>
                        <li>A representative time for the radar pass is also shown in the top panel's title.
                            This is the median time in the satellite's passage over the Arctic. </li>
                        <li>The name of the satellite variable that's plotted in the bottom panel
                            is given in the bottom panel's title. </li>
                        <li>The x and y tick labels on the top panel represent coordinates in the Polar
                            Stereographic coordinate reference system. There's no need to worry about those. </li>
                    </ul>

                        <i>High-level interpretation of the figure, in the context of moisture intrusion events:</i>  
                        The figure provides
                        insight into at least two air mass transformation events: one over Siberia, and one that stretches
                        from northern Canada to near the North Pole. Both events are in the "moisture intrusion"
                        stage of the transformation process, in which warm and moist air (shaded in green) is 
                        blowing from the mid-latitudes into the Arctic. Over the following days/weeks, 
                        air from these intrusions will drift across the Arctic,
                        gradually transforming into a drier/cooler air mass, before blowing back into the mid-latitudes with
                        some later storm. The clouds in both moisture intrusions are very deep (see bottom panel): both extend
                        from the near-surface to about 8,000 m. This makes sense--the moisture
                        intrusions are associated with storms, which have strong upward motion and therefore usually 
                        contain deep clouds. A third air mass, which looks like a bright green blob, may also be transforming 
                        in between the two moisture intrusions. This air mass likely entered the Arctic several days earlier 
                        and now contains shallower and more tenuous clouds. 
                    </p>

                    <p>CloudSat is a polar orbiting satellite equipped with a cloud-penetrating radar.
                        Through successive radar profiles of the atmosphere, CloudSat provides cross sections
                        of cloud structures underneath its orbit. An example of a cloud cross-section for Super 
                        Typhoon Atsani (2015) is provided below 
                        (<a href="https://phys.org/news/2015-08-cloudsat-slices-super-typhoon-atsani.html">image source</a>).

                    <p>Several CloudSat measurements are available through the data viewer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Radar Reflectivity: measures how much of the radar signal is scattered back 
                                to the radar at a given altitude. Profiles of reflectivity provide information 
                                about cloud structure, with higher reflectivity values typically indicative of 
                                "thicker" clouds. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Cloud Classification: Classification of each cloud layer, according to the algorithm described 
                                <a href="http://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/sites/default/files/products/files/2B-CLDCLASS_PDICD.P1_R05.rev1_.pdf">here</a>. 
                                Clouds are classified as cumulus (Cu), stratocumulus (Sc), stratus (St), altocumulus (Ac), 
                                altostratus (As), nimbostratus (Ns), cirrus (Ci), cirrostratus (Cs), or deep convective (DC). 
                            </li>
                            <li>Ice water content (g/m3): Mass of ice in a specific volume of air. The ice water 
                                content is inferred from the CloudSat observations and the temperature at each 
                                location. The retrieval methodology is described 
                                <a href="http://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/sites/default/files/products/files/2B-CWC-RO_PDICD.P1_R05.rev0_.pdf">here</a>.

                            <li>Liquid water content (g/m3): Mass of liquid in a specific volume of air. Like 
                                the ice water content, the liquid water content is inferred fromt he CloudSat 
                                measurements and the temperature at each location. The retrieval methodology is 
                                described <a href="http://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/sites/default/files/products/files/2B-CWC-RO_PDICD.P1_R05.rev0_.pdf">here</a>.

                    <h3>CALIPSO</h3>

                    <p>Mission page: <a href="https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/about/">https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/about/</a></p>
                    
                    <p>File format: HDF-EOS</p>
                    
                    <p>CALIPSO is another polar orbiting satellite, which traditionally has the same orbital trajectory as 
                        CloudSat and follows CloudSat by approximately 15 seconds. CALIPSO is outfit with 
                        a lidar instrument, which operates at wavelengths of 532 nm and 1064 nm and observes 
                        both clouds and aerosols. CALIPSO observations effectively complement CloudSat observations 
                        because they observe the same clouds, have a higher resolution, 
                        are more likely to detect thin liquid/ice cloud layers, and can detect 
                        clouds that are closer to the surface. However, CALIPSO osbervations cannot be used 
                        in place of CloudSat observations because the CALIPSO lidar is unable pass through 
                        thick clouds because it is so sensitive. Below is a labeled sample of CALIPSO lidar 
                        observations at the 532 nm wavelength

                    <h3>ERA5</h3>

                    

                    <p>Dataset page: <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5">https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5</a></p>

                    <p>ERA5 is the lastest atmospheric reanalysis product produced by the European Centre for 
                        Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). ERA5 uses a weather model and vast amounts of 
                        historical observations to infer the atmospheric state everywhere on the globe, hourly
                        from 1979-present. While ERA5 does not provide a perfect picture of the atmospheric 
                        state, it provides a good enough picture to infer large-scale setups for air mass 
                        transformation events. Below is nice high-level schematic of how reanalysis products 
                        are produced. While the schematic is specific to ozone, reanalysis works the same way for 
                        the quantities I use in this visualization tool

                    <p>Several ERA5 variables are available through the data viewer. Note that the altitudes of 
                        measurements at 850 mb are usually around 1500 m, while the altitudes of measurements 
                        at 700 mb are usually about 3000 m, depending on conditions.
